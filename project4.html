 <p>Jordan, officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is a country 
    in Western Asia. It is situated at the crossroads of Asia, Africa 
    and Europe, within the Levant region, on the East Bank of the 
    Jordan River. Amman is Jordan's capital and largest city, as well 
    as its economic, political, and cultural centre.
    <a id = "more" href = "#location">Read More..</a></p>

    <p id = "p1">Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south and 
    east, Iraq to the northeast, Syria to the north, and Israel, the 
    Palestinian West Bank, and the Dead Sea to the west. In the 
    southwest, it has a 26 km (16 mi) coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba 
    in the Red Sea. The Gulf of Aqaba separates Jordan from Egypt. 
    </p><br>

<img id = "history" src = "../images/history.png"><br><br>
 <p>Jordan is a young state that occupies an ancient land, one that 
    bears the traces of many civilizations. Separated from ancient 
    Palestine by the Jordan River, the region played a prominent role 
    in biblical history. The ancient biblical kingdoms of Moab, Gilead, 
    and Edom lie within its borders, as does the famed red stone city 
    of Petra, the capital of the Nabatean kingdom and of the Roman 
    province of Arabia Petraea. 
    <a id = "more2" href = "#history">Read More..</a></p>
    
    <p id = "p2"> British traveler Gertrude Bell said 
    of Petra, “It is like a fairy tale city, all pink and wonderful.” 
    Part of the Ottoman Empire until 1918 and later a mandate of the 
    United Kingdom, Jordan has been an independent kingdom since 1946. 
    It is among the most politically liberal countries of the Arab world, 
    and, although it shares in the troubles affecting the region, its 
    rulers have expressed a commitment to maintaining peace 
    and stability.</p><br>
 
<img id = "climate" src = "../images/climate.png"><br><br>
 <p>The climate in Jordan varies greatly. Generally, the further inland 
    from the Mediterranean, there are greater contrasts in temperature 
    and less rainfall. The country's average elevation is 812m (2,664ft). 
    The highlands above the Jordan Valley, mountains of the Dead Sea and 
    Wadi Araba and as far south as Ras Al-Naqab are dominated by a 
    Mediterranean climate, while the eastern and northeastern areas of the 
    country are arid desert. Although the desert parts of the kingdom 
    reach high temperatures, the heat is usually moderated by low humidity 
    and a daytime breeze, while the nights are cool.
    <a id = "more3" href = "#climate">Read More..</a></p>

<p id = "p3">Summers, lasting from May to September, are hot and dry, 
    with temperatures averaging around 32°C (90°F) and sometimes exceeding 
    40°C (104°F) between July and August. The winter, lasting from 
    November to March, is relatively cool, with temperatures averaging 
    around 13°C (55°F). Winter also sees frequent showers and 
    occasional snowfall in some western elevated areas.</p>

 <p>The Dead Sea, known in Arabic as Bahr Al-Mayit (Sea of Death) is the 
    lowest point on earth. It is a salt lake in between Jordan and Palestine.
    The shores of the Dead Sea are the lowest point on the surface of the 
    earth. The saline waters of the lake means no fish can survive in the 
    salty waters, hence the name. The other result of the salty water is 
    their renowned health and healing properties of the mud. You can also 
    float naturally in them.
    <a id = "info1" href = "#deadsea">Info for Tourists..</a></p>
    <p id = "p4">On the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened seaside 
    resort hotels near the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center, along 
    with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 
    hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.</p><br>

 <p>The city of Petra, capital of the Nabataean Arabs, is one of the most 
    famous archaeological sites in the world, it is Located 240 km south 
    of the capital Amman and 120 km north of the red sea town of Aqaba, 
    Petra the world wonder, is undoubtedly Jordan's most valuable treasure 
    and greatest tourist attraction, and it is visited by tourists from all 
    over the world. It is not known precisely when Petra was built, but the 
    city began to prosper as the capital of the Nabataean Empire from the 
    1st century BC, which grew rich through trade in frankincense, myrrh, 
    and spices. Petra is also known as the rose-red city, a name it gets 
    from the wonderful colour of the rock from which many of the city’s 
    structures were carved.  
    <a id = "info2" href = "#petra">Info for Tourists..</a></p>
    <p id = "p5">Most visitors stay in Petra town's many international-standard 
    hotels with reasonably-short walking access to Petra. There are also 
    more traditional homestays and lodgings available, even the chance to 
    stay in a cave. Visitors sometimes include those who have hiked or 
    raced across Jordan's southern deserts to get to Petra.</p><br>

 <p>Wadi Rum, known also as the Valley of the Moon (Arabic: Wādī al-Qamar), 
    is a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern Jordan 
    60km (37mi) to the east of Aqaba; it is the largest wadi (valley) in 
    Jordan. Wadi Rum is believed to get its name from the early name of 
    Iram of the Pillars, a lost city mentioned in the Quran.
    <a id = "info3" href = "#wadirum">Info for Tourists..</a></p>
    
    <p id = "p6">Wadi Rum is one of Jordan's most popular tourist sites and 
    attracts a large number of tourists from around the word. Wadi Rum is 
    home to the Zalabieh tribe, who developed eco-adventure tourism and 
    services throughout the protected area. They provide tours, guides, 
    accommodation and facilities. They also run restaurants and small shops 
    in the villages that provide meals and basic supplies for visitors. 
    Popular activities in the desert environment include 4x4 tours, camel 
    rides, camping under the stars, riding Arabian horses, hiking and 
    rock-climbing among the massive rock formations. Travellers staying in 
    the area can overnight in Bedouins style Camps located in the desert 
    or glamping hotels.
    <br><br>
    The area has been used as a background setting in a number of films. 
    Filmmakers are particularly drawn to it for science fiction films set on 
    Mars. Some well known films that were filmed here include: The Martian,
    Aladdin, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Dune.</p><br>

 <p>You haven’t tried falafel until you’ve eaten here. This legendary eatery, 
    more than 50 years old, is so popular with locals and visitors that 
    there’s stiff competition for tables, many of which overflow into the 
    alleyway. Aim for an early lunch or supper if you want to avoid queues, 
    although Hashem does a fantastic job of feeding the multitude in 
    record time.

    Mid-afternoon, it makes a great place to sip mint tea and watch 
    downtown slide towards siesta. Either way, flag down a waiter for 
    falafel, hummus, fuul (fava bean paste) and glasses of scalding hot 
    mint tea.</p><br>

 <p>Established in 2011, the first restaurant to serve a wide variety of 
    traditional Jordanian home-made dishes in an elegant-traditional 
    setting. Sufra Restaurant is a true sanctuary for an authentic 
    Jordanian dining experience.
     
    Housed in a lovely old villa with a terrace garden, this really is the 
    place to eat well, and Sufra is about as good as it gets when it comes 
    to traditional Jordanian cuisine. The signature mansaf (chicken or lamb 
    over rice with a thick, meaty broth) is a delight that will leave you 
    loosening your belt.</p><br>

 <p>This family-run restaurant serves a mix of traditional Arabic dishes,
